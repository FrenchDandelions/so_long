# so_long
This is my so_long and here's what you need to know :
-There's a max ofr the height/width of the map.
-Use make to get the mandatory program and make bonus to compile the bonus program.
-I was too lazy to create too many different maps so feel free to create more yourself.
-I was too lazy to create a bonus_maps and mandatory_maps directory so if you use the mandatory one you might end up with an invalid map :p.
-Finally to play after doing the make bonu command, you have to do this : ./so_long_bonus maps/valid_maps/map.ber (you can use any map you want inside the valid_maps directory, this is just an example).
Have fun :)
