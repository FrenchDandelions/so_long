# so_long
This is my so_long and here's what you need to know :

-There's a max for the height/width for the map.

-Use make to compile the mandatory program and make bonus to compile the bonus program.

-I was too lazy to create too many different maps so feel free to create more yourself.

-I was too lazy to create a bonus_maps and mandatory_maps directory so if you use the mandatory one you might end up with an invalid map :p.

-Finally this is how you should put your arguments to play : ./so_long_bonus maps/valid_maps/map.ber (you can use any map you want inside the valid_maps directory, this is just an example).

Have fun :)

ps: The bigger the map the longer it takes to load everything, so don't get mad, I have no idea why it takes so much time even when there is no enemy, sorry :(
